    <h1>Introduction to Computer Network</h1>
    <p>A <strong>computer network</strong> is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. Computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.</p>

    <p>The nodes of a computer network can include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or other specialized or general-purpose hosts. They are identified by network addresses and may have hostnames. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes and are rarely changed after initial assignment. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol.</p>

    <h2><mark>History</mark></h2>
    <p>Computer networking may be considered a branch of <em><strong>computer science, computer engineering, and telecommunications</strong></em>, since it relies on the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines. Computer networking was influenced by a wide array of technology developments and historical milestones.</p>
    <p>In the late 1950s, a network of computers was built for the U.S. military Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) radar system <sup>[1][2][3]</sup> using the Bell 101 modem. It was the first commercial modem for computers, released by AT&T Corporation in 1958. The modem allowed digital data to be transmitted over regular unconditioned telephone lines at a speed of 110 bits per second (bit/s).</p>
    <p>In 1959, Christopher Strachey filed a patent application for time-sharing and John McCarthy initiated the first project to implement time-sharing of user programs at MIT.<sup>[4][5][6][7]</sup> Stratchey passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider at the inaugural UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris that year.<sup>[8]</sup> McCarthy was instrumental in the creation of three of the earliest time-sharing systems (the Compatible Time-Sharing System in 1961, the BBN Time-Sharing System in 1962, and the Dartmouth Time Sharing System in 1963).</p>

    <p><strong><ins>Bus network:</ins></strong> all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original Ethernet, called 10BASE5 and 10BASE2.</p>

    <p><strong><ins>Star network:</ins></strong> all nodes are connected to a special central node.</p>

    <p><strong><ins>Ring network:</ins></strong> each node is connected to its left and right neighbor node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards.</p>

    <ins><strong>Mesh network:</ins></strong> <span>each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbors in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.</span>
